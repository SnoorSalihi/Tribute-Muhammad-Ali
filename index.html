                        The red Schwinn bike of twelve-year-old Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay, Jr.) is stolen
                        outside the annual Louisville Home Show. Reporting the theft to nearby policeman Joe
                        Martin, he expresses a desire to “whup” the culprit. Martin—who trains young
                        boxers—suggests he should first learn how to fight.

                        <strong>ENTERS CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL</strong><br>
                        Cassius struggles academically (he was later diagnosed with dyslexia) but becomes a
school celebrity for his dedication to training, including running to school every day
alongside the bus. He would visit the school as a hero after the Rome Olympic Games and
his legacy remains a point of Central pride.

                        <strong>WINS OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL</strong><br>
                        hree months out of high school, Ali competes at the 1960
Summer Olympics in Rome. Despite being afraid of
airplanes, Ali boards the flight while wearing an army
surplus parachute. He wins the light-heavyweight gold
medal, defeating Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland.

                        <strong>SIGNS WITH LOUISVILLE SPONSORING GROUP</strong><br>
                        At age 18, Clay enters a contract with a group of Louisville-area businessmen who will
finance his professional boxing career. Clay is represented by Alberta O. Jones, who
influenced his future philanthropic efforts. Clay would later donate the winnings of his
first professional fight to Kosair Children's Hospital.

                        <strong>MEETS MALCOLM X</strong><br>
                        Clay’s early boxing years are also formative ones in his spiritual journeys, headlined by
meeting Malcolm X in Detroit in 1962, and Drew Bundini Brown in the spring of 1963.
Training with Angelo Dundee at 5th Street Gym in Miami, Cassius is poised for the next
level, carrying 19 straight wins into his first shot at the heavyweight championship.

                        <strong>CLAY VS. SONNY LISTON (I)</strong><br>
                        In his first heavyweight title bout, Ali is a longshot to defeat
Liston, widely seen as unstoppable. Nonetheless, Ali
predicts “a total eclipse of the Sonny”—and indeed Liston
does not rise to the seventh round’s opening bell. “I’m the
greatest! I shook up the world!”

                        <strong>ANNOUNCES CONVERSION TO ISLAM, NAME CHANGE</strong><br>
                        The day after winning his first heavyweight belt, the fighter announces he is a proud
Muslim. He goes by the name Cassius X for nine days, then receives the new name of
Muhammad Ali from Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad.

                        <strong>FIRST VISIT TO AFRICA</strong><br>
                        Visiting Ghana, Nigeria, and Egypt, Ali inspires as a symbol of anti-colonialism. Welcomed
in Ghana as a son of Africa and a hero, Ali reclaims his roots by saying “I am an African.” At
the pyramids in Cairo, the BBC reports he “fuse[s] politics and religion” when giving the
Black power salute and shouting ‘God is great’ in Arabic.

                        <strong>REFUSES MILITARY DRAFT IN HOUSTON</strong><br>
                        Ali twice refuses to step forward when military induction officials call his name, citing his
conscientious objection to the war in Vietnam as a minister in the non-violent religion of
Islam. Convicted of draft evasion, he is stripped of his heavyweight title and boxing
licenses.

                        <strong>RALLIES WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. IN LOUISVILLE</strong><br>
                        Ali joins Martin Luther King, Jr. in Louisville at a rally for fair housing practices. The open
housing demonstrations had protesters calling for a boycott of the Kentucky Derby on
the same day, where members of the Ku Klux Klan offered to help keep order. City police
and Churchill Downs refused.
The two men fought for civil rights but shared different ideals, with King declining the
views of the Nation of Islam on integration.

                        <strong>ALI VS. JERRY QUARRY: FIRST POST-EXILE FIGHT</strong><br>
                        This fight was not approved by Georgia governor Lester Maddox, a segregationist who
declared a “day of mourning” over it. However, only Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell’s approval
was necessary, secured through the efforts of State Senator Leroy Johnson. Ali previewed
the fight in a drawing to Leroy Nieman, where Maddox is drawn running down the back
right aisle, yelling "Stop that fight!"

                        <strong>ALI VS. JOE FRAZIER (I)</strong><br>
In a chance to reclaim his title, Ali’s first heavyweight fight with Frazier matched two
undefeated fighters. However, Ali’s three years away from the ring made the difference in
a grueling 15 rounds. It is Ali’s first defeat and the start of the greatest rivalry in boxing
history.
